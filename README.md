# Guess

*Statistical* gender detection for Ruby

```ruby
Guess.gender("Don")
# => {:gender => "male", :confidence => 0.9965635738831615}
Guess.gender("Betty")
# => {:gender => "female", :confidence => 0.9992498124531133}
Guess.gender("Manhattan")
# => {:gender => "unknown", :confidence => nil}
```

Full names are also supported

```ruby
Guess.gender("Don Draper")
Guess.gender("Draper, Betty")
```

Data obtained from the [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/names_files.html), so it works best with American names.
